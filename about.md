This site is a little bit of everything. A little bit blog, a little bit portfolio, a little bit hobby.

Professionally I'm an Integrations Software Developer at Southern New Hampshire University, helping maintain a complex litany of applications across many business domains, while designing and implementing a real-time hub-and-spoke data ecosystem to subsume the current technology infrastructure. I work across Microsoft's tech stack -- from PowerShell to .NET C# to SQL -- as well as with MuleSoft, Colleague, and Banner. I solve the odd problem here or there with Python, and dabble in Docker and containerization for tools development for other Developers, Business Analysts, and Business Stakeholders.

Before that, I developed mobile-native feature libraries for Android and iOS games -- I cleaned up some older titles and used them as testing grounds for new features. Further back, I worked on Minecraft at Microsoft, bringing their cross-platform C++ Bedrock engine up to parity with the original Java version.

I'm a cross-platform user and developer. I particularly enjoy working on Linux, usually Ubuntu. My professional experience is mostly Windows, a decent helping of Mac OS, and a touch of Linux here and there.

As a professional, I'm especially passionate about Automation, Continuous Integration and Delivery, and Code Reuse. I love Git, anything CLI, and solving all sorts of problems with code.

Personally, I'm a gardener. I'm passionate about many things but none quite so much as growing plants and helping to rejuvenate the global ecosystem-in-crisis. There may be pictures of gardens past and present, as well as discussion about experiences in the garden. The 'environment' as it's often termed is the only one we get; we are now seeing the effects of anthropological global warming on a catastrophic scale, and this is only the beginning.

I also cook and bake; expect to see the odd recipe.
